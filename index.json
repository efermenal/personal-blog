I\u0026rsquo;m a software engineer with over 9 years of experience focus on .NET and Android development. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to create this site to share insights on topics I find interesting and maybe as a way to remind myself how to do certain things. So, my posts will likely revolve around technologies and tools used in mobile and app architecture.\nBesides tech, I\u0026rsquo;m an avid reader who enjoys exploring several genres as a way to relax, learn and hopefully understand different cultures. I also like traveling and in the recent years, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to get a significant trip at least once per year and hope to share my experience about this as well.\nFeel free to reach me out to share ideas, suggest topics or learn together.\nRegards!\n","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"About me"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/travels/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Travels"}]
