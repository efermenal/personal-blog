Hi there!

My name is Endherson and this is my first ever personal blog. I'm a software engineer with over 9 years of experience focus on .NET and Android development. I've decided to create this site to share insights on topics I find interesting and maybe as a way to remind myself how to do certain things. So, my posts will likely revolve around technologies and tools used in mobile and app architecture.

Besides tech, I'm an avid reader who enjoys exploring several genres as a way to relax, learn and hopefully understand different cultures. I also like traveling and in the recent years, I've tried to get a significant trip at least once per year and hope to share my experience about this as well.

Feel free to reach me out to share ideas, suggest topics or learn together.

Regards!
